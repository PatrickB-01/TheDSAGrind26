# Steps

0. Time Complexity
1. Learn Data Structures
 1. Learn the pros and cons
 2. Learn the data access patterns (traversal, manipulation, hierarchy)
2. Learn the Algorithmic Patterns (device and conquer , dynamic programming, greedy, backtracking) theoretically
3. Learn the Algorithms theoretically + programmatically (Neetcode)


# Tips

- Pay attention to the constraint as they can indicate the problem space 
    - Sorted or not sorted
    - Small n or big n (big will probably need O(logn))
    - in-place or not
- Start with a brute force, then optimize (time vs space) if no known pattern
    - sort, hash(cash), DP, other DS
- If no algo come to mind and no optimization works, then run through the algos
- 20 minutes max on a problem then go to solution + understand the reasoning
